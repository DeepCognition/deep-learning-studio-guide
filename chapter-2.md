# What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning. It is roughly inspired from the human brain structure and function. This is why it is also known as Artificial Neural Network.

To understand how deep learning differentiate itself from traditional machine learning, let's have a look at a simple problem where given an image we need to decide if this image is of dog or not.  Such problems are also know as image classification problems.

Typical machine learning pipeline include manual programming of computer code to extract features. In our example features could be number of legs, number of eyes, color etc.  These features are then fed to machine learning algorithm which then make a final decision if image contains a dog or not.

Deep learning generally removes the need to do such manual programming to extract features. It can handle raw pixel data and output the answer. Many times it also leads to higher accuracy.

Another important characterstic of deep learning is that it can continue to improve accuracy as more and more data is given in the training. This is not true with traditional machine learning algorithms.
