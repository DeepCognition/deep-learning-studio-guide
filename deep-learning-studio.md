# Deep Cognition Platform Introduction



Deep Cognition Platform is an integrated environment for deep learning developers that provides following capabilities:

1. **Deep Learning Studio**: Deep Learning Studio is our easiest to use software to develop, train and deploy deep learning models graphically.
   In general flow of building a deep learning model in Deep Learning Studio is as follows:
   1. Create a project and upload dataset
   2. Specify preprocessing options
   3. Build model with UI
   4. Train and Evaluate the model
   5. Download or deploy model 
2. **Preconfigured Deep Learning Development Environments**: We have containerized development environments available for virtually all popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, MxNet, Caffe-2, PyTorch etc. All you have to do is to install the environment and start working.  You will get full command line access to web based terminal and a VS Code based IDE editor.
3. **Jupyter Notebook: **Of-course Jupyter notebook is available for those who prefer to experiment in Jupyter notebook.
4. **Other tools**: Addition to above you will get access to tools to upload and manage your dataset and deployed models.
