# Deep Learning Studio Introduction

Deep learning studio is a framework that let you design, train, test and optimize deep learning model in the cloud. It also has inbuilt software to design the models without programming. This makes designing algorithms extremely fast.

In general flow of building a deep learning model in Deep Learning Studio is as follows:

1. Create a project and upload dataset
2. Specify preprocessing options
3. Build model with UI
4. Train and Evaluate the model
5. Download and deploy
